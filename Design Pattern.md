# Design Principle vs Design Pattern

<p>Design Principles provide high level guidelines to design batter software application. They do not provide implementation guidelines and are not bound to any programming language. The SOLID (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) principles are one of the most popular sets of design principles.</p>

<p>Design Pattern provides low-level solutions related to implementation of commonly occurring object-oriented problems. In other words, design pattern suggest a specific implementation for the specific object oriented programming problem.</p>

# Types of Design Patterns

<b>Design patterns are categorized into three groups: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.</b>

# Creational Design Pattern

<p>Creational Design Pattern solve the problems related to object creation. They help to abstract away object creation process that spread accross multiple classes.</p>

<b>The following five patterns are creational design patterns.</b>

<ol>
	<li>Singleton</li>
	<li>Abstract Factory</li>
	<li>Builder</li>
	<li>Factory Method</li>
	<li>Prototype</li>
</ol>

# Structural Design Pattern

<p>The structural design patterns suggest implementing relationships betwen classes and objects.</p>

<b>The following seven patterns are structural design patterns.</b>

<ol>
	<li>Adapter</li>
	<li>Composite</li>
	<li>Decorator</li>
	<li>Facade</li>
	<li>Proxy</li>
	<li>Flyweight</li>
	<li>Bridge</li>
</ol>

# Behavioral Design Pattern

<p>The behavioral design patterns suggest ways of communication between classes and objects.</p>

<b>The following seven patterns are behavioral design patterns:</b>

<ol>
	<li>Chain of Responsibility</li>
	<li>Strategy</li>
	<li>Observer</li>
	<li>Mediator</li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ol>
