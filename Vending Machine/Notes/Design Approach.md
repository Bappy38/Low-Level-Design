# Design Approach

We'll design this vending machine problem using the bottom-up design approach. For this purpose, we'll follow the steps below:

- Identify and design the smallest components first, like, a product in the machine.
- Use these small components to design bigger components, for example, the inventory.
- Repeat the steps above until we design the whole system, which is the vending machine.
