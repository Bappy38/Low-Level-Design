# Intro

<b>Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.</b>

<p>Singleton has almost the same pros and cons as global variables. Although they're super-handy, they break the modularity of your code.</p>

<p>You can't just use a class that depends on a Singleton in some other context, without carrying over the Singleton to the other context.</p>

# Identification

<p>Singleton can be recognized by a static creation method, which returns the same cached object.</p>
