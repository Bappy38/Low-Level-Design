- **Singleton Pattern:** Since logging library is used at multiple places, it becomes performance overhead if new instance has to be created every time. Therefore only single instance should be used throughout the application. Singleton instance is good option.
- **Observer Pattern:** The application code should only be responsible to push the log messages. Handling the log messages should be decoupled from the application. Pub-Sub model similar to observer pattern can be used.
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Since log messages follow a hierarchy, using Chain of Responsibility pattern is a good option. Each message type has its own handler, if the passed message to handler is not of its type then simply redirect it to the next handler in line.
- **Strategy Pattern:** There will be multiple logging sinks. Each severity level can have its own sink defined, e.g. Info messages to be printed in text file, Error messages to be printed on console etc. Choosing the sink is a Strategy which is decided by `config` properties.
