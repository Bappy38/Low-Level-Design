# Intro

<p>A Decorator is a structural design pattern that allows us to extend the behavior of object by placing these objects into a special wrapper class. The Decorator design pattern is quite popular in C# due to the fact that it helps us dynamically add behaviors to the wrapped object.</p>

# Structure

<p>The structure of this pattern consists of a Component class and a Concrete Component class from one part and a Decorator class and a Concrete Decorator class on the other side. The Concrete Decorator class is going to add additional behavior to our Concrete Component class.</p>

# When to use

<p>We should use this pattern when we have a need to add additional behavior to our objects. Furthermore, we should use it when it's too complicated to use inheritance or when it doesn't make sense at all.</p>
