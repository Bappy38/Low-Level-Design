<b>The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to compose objects into a tree structure and then work with that structure as if it is a single object. That also means using this design pattern makes sense when the part of our app can be represented as a tree.</b>

# Structure

<p>Composite design pattern consists of the following parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Component</b> is an interface that describe the operations that are common to either simple(leaf) or complex(non-leaf) elements of the tree.</li>
	<li><b>Leaf</b> is a single object, that doesn't have sub-elements. Our tree structure consists of more leaf objects.</li>
	<li><b>Composite</b> is an object that does have sub-elements (leaves or other composite objects). Interesting thing is that the Composite object isn't familiar with the concrete classes of its children. It communicates with its children via the Component interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we have a client, which works with all the elements through the Component interface.</p>

# Pros

- **Hierarchical Structure:** The Composite Pattern provides a way to represent complex hierarchical structures of objects. You can create tree like structures where both individual objects and composite objects can be treated uniformly.
- **Simplified Client Code:** Client can work both with individual objects and composites without needing to know the difference. This simplifies client code, making it more intuitive and easier to maintain.
- **Flexibility:** The pattern allows you to add and remove objects in the hierarchy without affecting the client code. This flexibility makes it easy to modify the structure of the tree.
- **Scalibility:** You can easily create more complex structure by nesting composites within composites, making it scalable solution for modeling part-whole hierarchies.
- **Code Reusability:** The pattern encourage the reuse of code. You can apply the same operations to both individual objects and composites, reducing duplication of code.

# Cons

- **Complex Implementation:** Implementing the Composite Pattern can be more complex compared to a non-composite approach. It involves creating a common interface for both individual objects and compositions, which can make the code more intricate.
- **Performance Overhead:** In some cases, traversing and performing operations on a composite structure can result in performance overhead, especially when dealing with deep and complex hierarchies.
- **Extra Memory Usage:** Composite structures can consume additional memory due to the need to store references to child objects within composite objects. This can be a concern when dealing with large hierarchies.
